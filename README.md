# **Coding History**

This GitHub repository includes the Jupyter notebooks I produced in my MChem course. 

## **Big Data, Big Science**

**PM_25_notebook.ipynb**

This notebook includes the import and analysis of open source data about the harmful emissions of PM2.5 particles across the UK. 

## **Statistical Thermodynamics**

**blanch-problem1.ipynb**

The aim of this exercise was to use the direct Monte Carlo method and the Metropolis algorithm to calculate the equation of state of real gases.

**blanch-problem2.ipynb**

The goal with this work was to model the harmonic oscillator using the Metropolis algorithm. 

**blanch-problem3.ipynb**

This work shows the SIR model of the spread of disease, modelled by the Monte Carlo method.

**blanch-problem4.ipynb**

The final exercise was to use the Monte Carlo method and the Metropolis algorithm to statistically calculate thermodynamic data such as heat capacity, entropy and internal energy of the Ising spin model. The theoreticl equations were also evaluated and used to calculate the same data, and the results were compared, reaching conclusions on the accuracy and use of these statistical methods.
